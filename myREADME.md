### IDEAS
- two paths 
1. make Raspberry Pi 5 stand alone server that can be connected to by any computer
    - may need a ssd to storage data & common commands used (merlin code)
2. make the computer in RSL the standing server 
    -  more practical and easier for usb communication for all the devices
        - about 6 different usb cords go to the computer from last years project


- movement of arms note: 
A DEXARM
- Y postive and negative movements are for the arm to move in and out (closer to base and farther away)
    - Y range is from 190mm to 300mm
        - suggested operation range: 230mm to 380

- X 
    - -320mm to 320mm

- Z 
    - -120mm to 160mm

- Home for the arm are the coord -> (X, Y, Z, E) => (0mm, +300mm, 0 mm, -200mm)
    - what is E??



- NOTE: using rotrics studio app will eat up all comm lines for talking to robot so it must be closed before python can be run
